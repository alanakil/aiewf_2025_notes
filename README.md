# AI Engineer World's Fair 2025 Notes

On 3-5 June 2025, I attended the [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://www.ai.engineer) lectures and workshops.
In this repo, I'm saving and sharing the notes I took during the conference (`notes.md`) along with a condensed version that I obtained using an LLM (`processed_notes.md`).
